Data analysis project on how income level and the metropolitan area are related to voting behavior in Finland.

## Datasets
There are two pre-prepared datasets:

In this project, we explore based on these two data sets (tulot2017.csv and ek2019.csv), how the
income level and the metropolitan area ( e.g. the voting area) are related to voting behavior in
Finland.
