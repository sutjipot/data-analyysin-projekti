# data-analyysin-projekti
Data analysis project on how income level and the metropolitan area are related to voting behavior in Finland.

There are two pre-prepared datasets:

tulot2017.csv : contains information about Finland the number of taxable income recipients, annual income and these of taxes paid by municipality in 2017. The variables of the data,

ek2019.csv :  contains the results of the 2019 parliamentary elections in Finland divided
by municipality (Alue). In addition, a constituency to which the voting area is belongs to is also
included.

In this project, we explore based on these two data sets (tulot2017.csv and ek2019.csv), how the
income level and the metropolitan area ( e.g. the voting area) are related to voting behavior in
Finland.

The final technical report can be seen in the pdf file.
